`python echo-server.py`

Your terminal will appear to hang. Thatâ€™s because the server is blocked, or suspended, on .accept().

Now, open another terminal window or command prompt and run the client:

`python echo-client.py`

To ensure the continuous operation of the echo server upon client connection, we can leverage Python's threading library, as demonstrated in the multithread-echo-server example. However, it's important to note that for large-scale productions with heavy traffic, this approach may not be optimal. In such scenarios, adopting asynchronous models could offer improvements. Additionally, considering the utilization of sockets implemented in other languages, such as Java, might be advisable.
